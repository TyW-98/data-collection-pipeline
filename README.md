# Data Collection Pipeline

This project builds a scraper to collect data from [Agoda's website](https://www.agoda.com) an online travel agency's website which allows travellers to look for hotels, flights and activities at a specific holiday destination. By using `Selenium` package, this project will look for hotels and resorts at the user's specified destination which are listed on Agoda. 

## __Milestone 1__ 
* Setup of GitHub repository to store project files

## __Milestone 2__ 
* Select which website to collect data from, in this case [Agoda](https://www.agoda.com) was chosen.
